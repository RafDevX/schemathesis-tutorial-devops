Let's get a better sense of how our working example, the Calculator API, works.
We want to get some understanding of what API calls are available and how a
client appliction might execute them to fulfill all their math needs.

First of all, let's find us some help:

## Automatic Documentation

To showcase how powerful using a standardized language is, open
[this link]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_3000}}) in another browser tab. As you can see,
the page shows detailed documentation for the Calculator API we've been looking
at â€” and the best part? It's being automatically generated by a generic tool
(called RapiDoc) based on the YAML document we just skimmed through.

If you run `cat index.html`{{}} in your terminal (remembering that you can later
press `Q`{{}} to quit), you'll see that the whole page is defined in just a few
lines of code, consisting mostly of RapiDoc settings to customize its looks. The
actual semantic work is done when the user opens the page, with RapiDoc pulling
the heavy weight to read the OpenAPI spec file and render it nicely for a human
to understand the API.

All this documentation, which would take humans many hours of manual labor to
accomplish, is magically obtainable in an instant just because we used a
standardized specification format that's *machine-readable*.

importantly, the openapi format is machine-readable, meaning that some tools can
understand it and do stuff, such as automatically generate docs: check out here
